[ALAIVE](https://www.snic.de/alaive/) is an innovation project that brings together artificial intelligence and life science for the monitoring and optimal control of living systems with a special focus on agriculture and health care. It is implemented in a verstaile interactive Internet platform that combines tools from natuaral language processing and emotion inference for a natural and emphatic human-machine interaction.

## PLANTAR

PLANTAR is an Internet platform that efficiently monitors and controls the state of plants and soil in horticultural and agricultural crops. The platform is able to simulate the evolution of individual plants for different fertigation and irrigation strategies and to choose those that would lead to a maximization of the crop yield with a low variance in the growth rate, minimizing the use of water and nutrient resources. With PLANTAR all the plants achieve the maximal growth at the same planned time, which permits to precisely plan harvesting in an efficient manner. This is achieved thanks to state of the art artificial intelligence techniques that automatically decide the treatment to apply to each plant according to the plant’s individual needs rather than establishing general irrigation and fertigation strategies common to all the plants, as done traditionally. This also leads to a drastic reduction in the resources needed for an optimal crop yield, making a more sustainable management of water and nutrients, maximizing sustainability while reducing costs.

## HRV2
HRV2 is an Internet platform for the permanent monitoring of ambulatory cardiovascular patients. The monitoring is carried out from parameters derived from biometric signals, such as heart rate and level of activity, obtained from commercially available wearable devices (e.g. smartwatches). The sensor information is sent to an artificial intelligence server through an Android application for smartphones. The AI server combines advanced techniques for signal processing and artificial intelligence to transform the raw signals into medical parameters that characterize the health state of patients. These parameters are used to monitor, online, the patients’ health state as well as to estimate their acute cardiovascular risk, i.e. the risk to suffer a dangerous cardiovascular event in the next following hour (e.g. dangerous arrhythmias or sudden cardiac arrest). According to this risk estimation, an emergency protocol is triggered that coordinates actions that should be taken by the patient, by a responsible relative of the patient, and by the patient's clinician. The instruction of actions are sent to the smartphones of the patient, relative, and clinician through Android applications and SMS. The clinician has access to an interactive webpage that permits exploring the health history of the patient, the risk estimations, and the triggered emergency protocols. The webpage also provides tools for managing the set of patients under the supervision of the clinician. In [this link](http://134.76.19.30/PrototypeDemo_dev/index.php) you can find a direct access to the HRV2 platform. For further access and further details about the platform, please contact us.
