[ALAIVE](https://www.snic.de/alaive/) brings together tools from computational neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and signal processing into a versatile interactive cognitive platform. The platform combines algorithms for reasoning and machine learning to solve optimization and decision-making problems using sensory data (see our prototypes for agriculture and health care). These algorithms are connected to a high-complexity neural network that emulates human emotions and basic neurological responses in the brain during a human-like conversation. The neural network is used to provide our platform with different personalities depending on the application that permits establishing an emphatic human-machine conversation using natural language oriented to the specific goal of the user. The access to the platform is easy and straightforward through graphical web interfaces. Its applications range from precision agriculture and health care to mental well-being, art, and culture.

## PLANTAR
[PLANTAR](http://vm19030.virt.gwdg.de/alaive/alaive/Agriculture.html) is an Internet platform that efficiently monitors and controls the state of plants and soil in horticultural and agricultural crops. The platform is able to simulate the evolution of individual plants for different fertigation and irrigation strategies and to choose those that would lead to a maximization of the crop yield with a low variance in the growth rate, minimizing the use of water and nutrient resources. With PLANTAR all the plants achieve the maximal growth at the same planned time, which permits to precisely plan harvesting in an efficient manner. This is achieved thanks to state of the art artificial intelligence techniques that automatically decide the treatment to apply to each plant according to the plant’s individual needs rather than establishing general irrigation and fertigation strategies common to all the plants, as done traditionally. This also leads to a drastic reduction in the resources needed for an optimal crop yield, making a more sustainable management of water and nutrients, maximizing sustainability while reducing costs.

## HRV2
[HRV2](http://vm19030.virt.gwdg.de/alaive/alaive/Health_Care.html) is an Internet platform for the permanent monitoring of ambulatory cardiovascular patients. The monitoring is carried out from parameters derived from biometric signals, such as heart rate and level of activity, obtained from commercially available wearable devices (e.g. smartwatches). The sensor information is sent to an artificial intelligence server through an Android application for smartphones. The AI server combines advanced techniques for signal processing and artificial intelligence to transform the raw signals into medical parameters that characterize the health state of patients. These parameters are used to monitor, online, the patients’ health state as well as to estimate their acute cardiovascular risk, i.e. the risk to suffer a dangerous cardiovascular event in the next following hour (e.g. dangerous arrhythmias or sudden cardiac arrest). According to this risk estimation, an emergency protocol is triggered that coordinates actions that should be taken by the patient, by a responsible relative of the patient, and by the patient's clinician. The instruction of actions are sent to the smartphones of the patient, relative, and clinician through Android applications and SMS. The clinician has access to an interactive webpage that permits exploring the health history of the patient, the risk estimations, and the triggered emergency protocols. The webpage also provides tools for managing the set of patients under the supervision of the clinician. For further access and further details about the platform, please contact us.

## WELLY
<span style="color:#71B4F7">WELLY</span> is an interactive cognitive platform desiged to keep company to elderly through emphatic conversations and images. The system generates and updates a model of the emotional and health state of the elderly and orients the dialogue to monitor and improve this state. The platform combats negative emotions such as loneliness, boredom, and sadness by asking questions to define the specific needs of the person and generating a dialogue combined with images that helps to address these needs. Among other things, the system can tell stories, let the elderly converse with an avatar of a relative or a (virtual) friend, ask questions about the elderly's life and past experiences, memorize them, and use them in future conversations. It can also assist the elderly in everyday tasks, such as cooking, and help the elderly to remember where are the elements in the house (where is the pepper, in which drawer is a specific medicine, etc.). The platform is easy to use. It runs through an Internet browser and does not require any special device or installation.
